# Deployment Guide - RV Adventures

## Quick Start - Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended - Automatic Deployments)

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nicolasleroo/rv-adventures
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: RV Adventures planning website"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.com
   - Follow GitHub's instructions to push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rv-adventures.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Done! Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel will auto-deploy

### Option 2: Direct Vercel Deploy (Manual)

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from terminal**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nicolasleroo/rv-adventures
   vercel login
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to complete deployment

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

Once deployed on Vercel:

1. Go to your project settings on Vercel
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your domain's DNS records as instructed by Vercel

**Domain Registrars to Consider:**
- Namecheap (affordable, good UI)
- Google Domains (simple, reliable)
- Cloudflare (includes CDN, DDoS protection)

## Environment Configuration

Since this is a static site with no backend, no environment variables are needed!

All data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage.

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Visit your deployed site and test all pages
- [ ] Test the RV calculator with sample numbers
- [ ] Add a test checklist item
- [ ] Add a test destination
- [ ] Test the budget tracker
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test in different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Verify robots.txt is blocking search engines (this is a private site)

## Making Updates

### If using GitHub + Vercel:
```bash
# Make your changes to the code
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
# Vercel will automatically deploy!
```

### If using Vercel CLI:
```bash
# Make your changes
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Privacy & Security Notes

**Important:** This site is configured as PRIVATE (not for public use)

- `robots.txt` blocks all search engines
- HTML includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
- Consider adding password protection via Vercel:
  - Vercel Pro plan allows password protection
  - Or use Vercel's "Protected Deployments" feature

### Adding Password Protection (Vercel Pro)

1. Go to project Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection
2. Enable "Password Protection"
3. Set a password
4. Share the password only with those who need access

## Backup Your Data

**CRITICAL:** Since all data is stored in browser LocalStorage:

1. **Browser data is NOT backed up to the cloud**
2. **Clearing browser data will DELETE everything**
3. **Switching browsers/devices means starting fresh**

### Future Enhancement Ideas:
- Add "Export Data" button to download JSON backup
- Add "Import Data" to restore from backup
- Integrate with Firebase/Supabase for cloud sync
- Make it a PWA for offline access

## Troubleshooting

### Site not loading?
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify all files were uploaded
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Data not saving?
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Check if browser allows LocalStorage
- Try different browser
- Check browser console for errors

### Mobile menu not working?
- Clear browser cache
- Check JavaScript console
- Verify JavaScript files are loading

### Calculator not calculating?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all form fields have valid numbers
- Try refreshing the page

## Performance Optimization

The site is already optimized, but for even better performance:

1. **Compress images** (if you add any)
   - Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Max 200KB per image

2. **Vercel automatically handles:**
   - HTTPS
   - Global CDN
   - Compression (Gzip/Brotli)
   - Cache headers (configured in vercel.json)
